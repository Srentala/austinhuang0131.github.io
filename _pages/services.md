## Developer and Translation Services
I can write you a Discord/Telegram bot, or do some translation work for you.

* I wrote a bot for [InFlamesWeMust](http://twitch.tv/inflameswemust), which contains stream notifications and follower checks.
* I also wrote [DiscordTel](http://discordtel.austinhuang.me) and [Metagon](https://metagon.cf).
* My translation works are listed [here](https://austinhuang.me/#i-also-help-in-some-other-projects).
* Depending on the size, I might be able to host your bot. However, as a precaution, you should get a host. I will be able to set up your host.
* Pay-what-you-want.
