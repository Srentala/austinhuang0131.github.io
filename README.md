Well, I expect you don't expect too much here.

## Some introduction?
Oh, yeah. So, I'm Austin Huang. I was born in Shanghai but moved to Montréal. I am a high school guy. I made [a Telegram bot](http://metagon.js.org) and a big [Discord server](http://discord.io/0131).

### Hobbies?
Coding, of course. Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did. Then he went to UCC in Toronto and I came to Montréal.

#### He says it's stressful?
So why shouldn't I? When the upper 50%~60% Grade 7 students literally learnt everything in Grade 10, how do you feel? When you have to spent 2 hours on regular homework every single day, but 3 more hours on extra stuff, how do you feel? If you still don't understand, [this](http://bfy.tw/9cpo) seems to be the only way (Remember we are far more stressful than the British says, they don't fully understand us either).

Nowadays, it seems like going abroad is the only way: Migrants occupying big cities, pushing local residents out from the best resources. Also there's actually not *that* many things you need to learn for your career unless you are a mathematician.

### Are you sure you are using this site correctly?
No.

#### So why?
Github has that student pack. I'm just trying to enjoy most of its benefits, including free .me domain for 1 year.

##### Did you actually apply for the pack as a secondary guy?
Yes. And they approved. It's *not* exclusively for universities *through http://nc.me is for universities but it didn't really check that because I am approved by Github already and they think Github thinks I'm a univ guy.*
