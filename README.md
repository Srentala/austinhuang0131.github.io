Well, I expect you don't expect too much here.

## Some introduction?
Oh, yeah. So, I'm Austin Huang. I was born in Shanghai but moved to Montréal. I am a high school guy. I made [a Telegram bot](http://metagon.js.org) and a big [Discord server](http://discord.io/0131).

### Hobbies?
Coding, of course. Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did. Then he went to UCC in Toronto and I came to Montréal.

#### He says it's stressful?
So why shouldn't I? When the upper 50%~60% Grade 7 students literally learnt everything in Grade 10, how do you feel? When you have to spent 2 hours on regular homework every single day, but 3 more hours on extra stuff, how do you feel? If you still don't understand, [this](http://bfy.tw/9cpo) seems to be the only way.
