Well, I expect you don't expect too much here. Also, here's my Visitor counter (Disable AdBlock to see this): <a href="http://www.reliablecounter.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.reliablecounter.com/count.php?page=austinhuang.me&digit=style/plain/13/&reloads=0" alt="" title="" border="0"></a><br /><a href="http://" target="_blank" style="font-family: Geneva, Arial; font-size: 9px; color: #330010; text-decoration: none;"></a>

## Some introduction?
Oh, yeah. So, I'm Austin Huang. I was born in Shanghai but moved to Montr√©al. I am a high school guy. I made [a Discord bot](http://github.com/austinhuang0131/discordtel) (It reached 2100+ guilds!) and [a Telegram bot](http://metagon.js.org) by myself. I also organized [a cross-Discord-bots currency exchange](http://discoin.gitbooks.io/docs).

### Hobbies?
Coding, modelling, mapping, reading news, learning AP and French online, and listening to sick tones are things I do a lot. And Anime sometimes. Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports.

I sometimes do Japanese-to-English/Chinese translations/consultations for translations. [This](http://luluidoll.jp/tagged/english) is one of them. And also [this](http://disboard.org/zh-cn)

### Hardware?
A school-provided MacBook Air ($500) plus several shared VPS. That's it.

All my projects are hosted by other people.

### Other online activities?
* [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/austinhuang)
* [KeyBase](https://keybase.io/austinhuang)
* [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=the_cafes)
* [OpenGeofiction](http://wiki.opengeofiction.net/wiki/index.php/Esthyra)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/montreal0131), although rarely used.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did.

#### He says it's stressful?
So why shouldn't I? When the upper 50%~60% Grade 7 students literally learnt everything in Grade 10, how do you feel? When you have to spent 2 hours on regular homework every single day, but 3 more hours on extra stuff, how do you feel? If you still don't understand, [this](http://bfy.tw/9cpo) seems to be the only way (Remember we are far more stressful than the British says, they don't fully understand us either).

Nowadays, it seems like going abroad is the only way: Migrants occupying big cities, pushing local residents out from the best resources. Also there's actually not *that* many things you need to learn for your career unless you are a mathematician.

You born a Chinese, you live a Chinese, unfortunately.

### Are you sure you are using this site correctly?
No.

#### So why?
Github has that student pack. I'm just trying to enjoy most of its benefits, including free .me domain for 1 year.

After expiry, I'll use a .tk domain.

### Political position?
I don't think you'll ask this question. *laughs* I tried as hard as possible to be neutral - i.e. I will tend to judge basically, like "No matter left or right, whoever conducted violence is definitely wrong", or "We can get some refugee in, but we need to make sure they *are* in need of taking refuge, not testing on our government".
