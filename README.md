## Explain that huge SVG image?
Knew it.

### Born in Shanghai...in 2015.
That's right. I came to Montr√©al to study.

### I created two chatbots
* [DiscordTel](http://github.com/austinhuang0131/discordtel) is a Discord bot that simulates the process of phone dialing on Discord servers. It has reached more than 2300 guilds.
* [Metagon](https://metagon.cf) is a multi-platform bot that has a lot of useful tools.

### and an exchange system between a bunch of chatbots
* [Discoin](http://discoin.gitbooks.io/docs) is a currency exchange serving 7 Discord bots.

### I earned $50 from one of my bots.
$ = CAD. Maybe a bit less (somewhere between $45 and $50), but anyways: I earned a lot from DiscordTel.

### I also help in some other projects
You can see my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/austinhuang0131). I am currently involved in these projects:

* [MCRep.us](http://mcrep.us)

I do a lot of translations, too, usually from Japanese or Chinese to English. I have done translations in these projects:

* [Disboard](http://disboard.org/zh-cn)
* [Hashimoto Lulu project](http://luluidoll.jp/tagged/english)
* [ShionKeys](/ShionKeys)

etc.

### and I am pretty active online.

* [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/austinhuang)
* [KeyBase](https://keybase.io/austinhuang)
* [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=the_cafes)
* [OpenGeofiction](http://wiki.opengeofiction.net/wiki/index.php/Esthyra)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/montreal0131), although rarely used.

## May I ask some questions?
Obviously, sure.

### I'd like to demand your services.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSGYm6NXhc8L_vFsWZjmz6LULB89CTKX5IiRWPAAurgbF43g/viewform).

### Hobbies?
Coding, modelling, mapping, reading news, learning AP and French online, and listening to sick tones are things I do a lot. And Anime sometimes. Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports.

### Hardware?
A school-provided MacBook Air ($500) plus several shared VPS. That's it.

All my projects are hosted by other people.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did.

### Are you sure you are using this site correctly?
No.

#### So why?
Github has that student pack. I'm just trying to enjoy most of its benefits, including free .me domain for 1 year.

~~After expiry, I'll use a .tk domain.~~ I'll probably renew it.
