Running a Discord server is not easy and I've seen numerous people struggling with it. From my personal experience, here's some advice from me, I guess.

~~tfw lazy to give individual advice in #request-server-assistance~~

## Questions to ask yourself
Before making a Discord server, you should ask yourself these questions:

1. What's the purpose of your server, in the most specific way possible?
2. Is it unique?
3. How will you engage your population in the future?

There is no correct answer to them, but you should keep them in mind. If you answered "No" to question 2, you should focus more on question 3.

## Let's start!
### With a specific purpose
Personally, I suggest that you should find some people (10 is enough) who have interest or expertise in your field to start the server, so that it'll be easier to find new members as they'll have a reference in what's going on.

### With a generic purpose
Just a community? It's not the end of

## How do I keep my members in my server?
It's not a business of attracting more people: It's more like a business of keeping your population in shape. So, servers need events to give people initiatives.

### Events
Let's break them up into 3 types.
#### Type 1: Strengthening your purpose => Get new people, and keep your members
You're running a game server? Game tournaments! You're running an art server? Work exchange! You're running an anime server? What about dub challenge?

This type of events highly depends on your server's purpose and also resources available to you. They are highly effective but at the same time consume a lot of your time and energy (Question 3) so you should keep a balance between these events and regular activities.

#### Type 2: Generic engagement activities => Keep your members
Minigames (Like [Cards Against Humanity](http://pretendyoure.xyz/zy/), [UNO](http://www.richgieg.com/runo) and [Webopoly](http://www.webopoly.org/), sure you'll find more) as well as other small events (Like movie night, karaoke, etc) can be used to keep your members busy. They require less effort than type 1 events, but they won't bring in new members, and there is a limit on how many you can do: Too many minigames can dilute your purpose which may lead to losing members.

#### Type 3: Give one shot => Get new people
Giveaways with attractive prizes will surely bring in new people [when used with proper advertisement](#advertisement). They might not have an effect on your existing members though.

But after all, you can't do events all the time. So there's also...

### Regular activities
Chat, obviously! But chat about what?
