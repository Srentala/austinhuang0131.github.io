## Explain that huge SVG image?
Knew it.

### Born in Shanghai...in 2015.
That's right. I came to Montr√©al to study.

### I created two chatbots
* [DiscordTel](http://github.com/austinhuang0131/discordtel) is a Discord bot that simulates the process of phone dialing on Discord servers. It ~~has~~ had reached more than 2300 guilds, which was erased by Discord. Currently in the process of restructuring.
* [Metagon](https://metagon.cf) is a multi-platform bot that has a lot of useful tools. Currently my main focus.

### and an exchange system between a bunch of chatbots
* [Discoin](http://discoin.gitbooks.io/docs) is a currency exchange serving 7 Discord bots.

### I earned $50 from one of my bots.
$ = CAD. Maybe a bit less (somewhere between $45 and $50), but anyways: I earned a lot from DiscordTel.

### I also help in some other projects
You can see my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/austinhuang0131). I am currently involved in these projects:

* [Discord.Services](http://discord.services) (Staff)
* [Disboard](http://disboard.org/) (Co-Owner)
* [MCRep.us](http://mcrep.us) (Developer)

I do some translations, too, usually from Japanese or Chinese to English. I have done translations in these projects:

* [Hashimoto Lulu project](http://luluidoll.jp/tagged/english)
* [ShionKeys](/ShionKeys) (Incomplete)
* [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/austinhuang0131/) projects:
  * 30% of Chinese translation in [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/)
  * 1% of Chinese translation in [Andor's Trail](https://andorstrail.com/)
  
I once own these projects:

* [Discord Server Hub](http://discord.shoutwiki.com) (Owner), known for the first Global Ban List in Discord (Highly controversial). Abandoned due to difficulties in maintenance.

## May I ask some questions?
Obviously, sure.

### Hobbies?
Coding, modeling, mapping, reading news, learning AP and French online, and listening to sick beats are things I do a lot. And Anime sometimes. Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports.

Recently I found myself enjoying creative writing.

### Hardware?
A school-provided MacBook Air ($500) plus several shared VPS from online people and free services. That's it.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did.

### What about a formal resume, *please?*
Nah man. *skirt skirt dab dab*

### I mean you didn't answer my question...
You can ask it [here](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131.github.io/issues), then.
