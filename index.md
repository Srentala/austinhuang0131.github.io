## I'm Austin Huang.

Hi there! I'm a high school student who [writes JavaScript, operates chatbots](#my-coding-projects), [helps other projects](#projects-i-am-involved-in), [translates websites](#my-translations), [takes photos](#my-photos), studies, and [explores online stuff](#my-other-online-stuff). So let's see what I'm up to.

## My coding projects
* [DiscordTel](http://github.com/austinhuang0131/discordtel) is a Discord bot that simulates the process of phone dialing on Discord servers. It ~~has~~ had reached more than 2300 guilds, which was erased by Discord. Currently in the process of restructuring. Also, I earned $50 from it.
* [Metagon](https://metagon.cf) is a multi-platform bot that has a lot of useful tools. Currently my main focus.
* [Discoin](http://discoin.gitbooks.io/docs) is a currency exchange serving 7 Discord bots.

## Projects I am involved in
You can see my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/austinhuang0131). I am currently involved in these projects:

* [BotList.space](http://botlist.space) (Staff)
* [Disboard](http://disboard.org/) (Co-Owner)

I also [write private bots](/services) for individuals.

## My translations
I do some translations, too, usually from Japanese or Chinese to English. I have done translations in these projects:

* [BotList.space](http://botlist.space) (All of Chinese translation)
* [Hashimoto Lulu project](http://luluidoll.jp/tagged/english)
* [Terminal.ink Bot List](https://ls.terminal.ink/) (All of Chinese translation)
* [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/austinhuang0131/) projects:
  * 30% of Chinese translation in [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/)
  * 1% of Chinese translation in [Andor's Trail](https://andorstrail.com/)
  
## My photos
I have a white Pentax K-50.

## May I ask some questions?
Obviously, sure.

### Hobbies?
Coding, modeling, mapping, reading news, learning AP and French online, and listening to sick beats are things I do a lot. And Anime sometimes. Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports.

Recently I found myself enjoying creative writing.

### Hardware?
A school-provided MacBook Air ($500) plus several shared VPS from online people and free services. That's it.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did.

### What about a formal resume, *please?*
Nah man. *skirt skirt dab dab*

### Hey, you look cool. How can I support you?
You can either [donate](/donate.html) or start the Monero miner below.
