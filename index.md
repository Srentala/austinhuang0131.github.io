## My coding projects
* [DiscordTel](http://github.com/austinhuang0131/discordtel) is a Discord bot that simulates the process of phone dialing on Discord servers. It ~~has~~ had reached more than 2300 guilds, which was erased by Discord. Currently in the process of restructuring. Also, I earned $50 from it.

## May I ask some questions?
Obviously, sure.

### Hobbies?
Coding, modeling, mapping, reading news, learning AP and French online, and listening to sick beats are things I do a lot. And Anime sometimes. Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports.

Recently I found myself enjoying creative writing.

### Hardware?
A school-provided MacBook Air ($500) plus several shared VPS from online people and free services. That's it.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did.

### What about a formal resume, *please?*
Nah man. *skirt skirt dab dab*

### I mean you didn't answer my question...
You can ask it [here](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131.github.io/issues), then.
