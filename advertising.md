* To add your *server-listing* server into this list, your server should have at least 200 members and a well-maintained listing (Expired invites are frequently cleaned, tidy categories, etc.).
* Currently, there is no restriction in adding listing websites or bots, as long as they're functional.
* No bot-listing servers.

The bot was caught [monitored server messages before](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/5sz8qo/does_serverhound_secretly_log_your_servers_chat/) <sup>In mid-2017, I worked with DiscordList and witnessed that one of their small teams have access to their "Radar", which catches global messages that matches a specific keyword</sup> and [releasing all user data on another website](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/79e79e/serverhound_website_taken_down/) called Discord.Solutions. Some users reported that the website seems to be a target for raiding. Before, they also show live message in listed guilds and per-member stats on the website, but it seems to be removed. Also, the owner of the websites is currently involved in crypto pumping <sup>Left sidebar, last button</sup>.
