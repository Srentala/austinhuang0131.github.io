## Free people for your Discord server!

Server owners hate me! But today you'll see this one crazy and simple trick to increase your Discord server's size IMMEDIATELY!

Found more places to advertise? Please comment at the end of this page.

* To add your *server-listing* server into this list, your server should have *at least* 500 members (Reaching the population size does **NOT** guarantee a spot.) and a well-maintained listing (Expired invites are frequently cleaned, tidy categories, etc.).
* Currently, there is no restriction in adding listing websites or bots, as long as they're functional.
* No bot-listing servers.

### Websites

* [Discord.me](http://discord.me)
  * Largest (36000+ servers), most traffic
  * Server owners can bump every 6 hours, on site only

  * Server owners can bump every 4 hours for free, on bot only
  * **WARNING!** ServerHound, their listing bot, [has a terrible reputation](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=serverhound) and is frequently considered a botnet. The bot was caught [monitored server messages before](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/5sz8qo/does_serverhound_secretly_log_your_servers_chat/) <sup>In mid-2017, I worked with DiscordList and witnessed that one of their small teams have access to their "Radar", which catches global messages that matches a specific keyword</sup> and [releasing all user data on another website](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/79e79e/serverhound_website_taken_down/) called Discord.Solutions. Some users reported that the website seems to be a target for raiding. Before, they also show live message in listed guilds and per-member stats on the website, but it seems to be removed. Also, the owner of the websites is currently involved in crypto pumping <sup>Left sidebar, last button</sup>.
