Hello! You have reached the introduction page for [@mtl0131bot](https://t.me/mtl0131bot). The bot is used to host all my private coding contracts. If you want me to write you some functions for your own group/channel, it'll be stored in this bot.

Want me to code for you? Contact me at [@austinhuang](https://t.me/austinhuang) or read more details [here](https://austinhuang.me/services).
